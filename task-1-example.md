# Task 1 Example Implementation

## Task Configuration

TASK_NUMBER = 1

TASK_NAME = Project Foundation & Setup

**Can you please utilize desktop-commander get_config and identify the tools you will use to implement Task 1 to completion? Utilize clear-thought, puppeteer, and desktop-commander as you see fit to think through/plan/map, implement, and verify.**

## Project Context: Elena Vasquez Photography Portfolio

I'm demonstrating a systematic LLM-driven development process using MCP tools to build a professional photography portfolio website. Please reference `demo_tasklist.md` for the complete project vision and task breakdown.

**⚠️ DEMO REQUIREMENTS**
- This is a demonstration of systematic task-based development
- Each task should build logically on previous completed tasks
- Use ONLY the specified tech stack: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- Run development server on port 3001 (port 3000 is in use)
- Focus on production-quality output that could represent a real photographer

**Project Vision:**
- **Photographer**: Elena Vasquez - Travel & Cultural Photography specialist
- **Brand**: "Capturing the soul of places through the people who call them home"
- **Style**: Warm, authentic, documentary-style with rich earth tones
- **Target**: Professional portfolio to attract travel magazines, cultural organizations

**Brand Identity & Design System:**
```css
/* Elena's Brand Colors */
--terracotta: #d2691e;      /* Warm, earthy primary */
--forest-green: #2d5016;    /* Deep, natural secondary */
--cream: #f5f5dc;           /* Soft, warm neutral */
--charcoal: #36454f;        /* Professional dark */
--warm-white: #fefefe;      /* Clean background */

/* Typography */

--font-body: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif; /* Clean, readable */
```

**Current Session Focus:**
Work on **Task 1: Project Foundation & Setup**

**Implementation Requirements:**
1. **Follow the Wireframe**: Use the ASCII wireframe as your visual guide for layout and structure
2. **Apply Brand Identity**: Implement Elena's color palette and typography consistently
3. **Build on Previous Tasks**: Ensure this task integrates with previously completed work
4. **Production Quality**: Create code and design that could represent a real photographer
5. **Use Stock Images**: Source appropriate travel/cultural photography from Unsplash
6. **Responsive Design**: Ensure all layouts work on mobile, tablet, and desktop
7. **Performance Focus**: Optimize images and code for fast loading

**Available MCP Tools:**
- **desktop-commander**: File operations, project setup, development server management
- **clear-thought**: Strategic thinking, problem-solving, decision-making, planning
- **puppeteer**: Visual testing, screenshots, browser automation for verification

**Quality Standards:**
