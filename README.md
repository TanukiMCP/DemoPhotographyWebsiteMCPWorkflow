## 🛠️ MCP Tools Showcase

This demo leverages three powerful MCP tools:

| Tool | Purpose | Demo Usage |
|------|---------|------------|
| **🧠 clear-thought** | Strategic thinking, planning, problem-solving | Task breakdown, architecture decisions, UX planning |
| **🖥️ desktop-commander** | File operations, development environment | Project setup, code generation, server management |
| **🌐 puppeteer** | Browser automation, visual testing | Screenshots, UI verification, responsive testing |

## Creating Your Own Tasklists

### The System That Actually Works

Here's the step-by-step process I used to break down this complex project:

**Step 1: Start with the complete vision**
Don't just think about features - imagine the actual user experience. What does someone see when they land on the site? How do they navigate? What's their journey from first visit to taking action?

**Step 2: Work backwards from the end goal**
I started with "Elena needs a portfolio that gets her hired" and worked backwards to identify what that actually requires: professional galleries, compelling about page, clear services, contact forms, etc.

**Step 3: Find the logical sequence**
Some things have to happen before others. You can't build a gallery system before you have a design system. You can't add animations before you have the basic functionality.

**Step 4: Make each task completable in one focused session**
If a task takes more than 2 hours, it's too big. Break it down further.

**Step 5: Define "done" clearly**
Vague success criteria like "looks good" don't work. Instead: "Hero section loads in under 2 seconds, displays properly on mobile, includes working CTA buttons."

### The Tasklist Template

Copy this structure for your own projects:

```markdown
## Task [N]: [What you're actually building]

### What this accomplishes
One clear sentence about the outcome.

### You're done when:
- [ ] Specific thing you can verify
- [ ] Another specific thing you can verify  
- [ ] Integration with previous tasks works

### Technical requirements
- Specific technologies/frameworks
- Performance targets
- Browser/device compatibility

### How to verify it works
1. Take screenshots of key functionality
2. Test the user flow manually
3. Check performance/accessibility

### How this connects to other tasks
- Builds on: [previous task]
- Enables: [next task]
```

### What Makes Tasks Actually Work

**Good tasks have:**
- Clear scope (you know exactly what to build)
- Measurable outcomes (you know when you're done)
- Realistic timeframe (completable in one session)
- Clear dependencies (you know what comes before/after)

**Bad tasks look like:**
- "Make the site look professional" (too vague)
- "Build the entire user dashboard" (too big)
- "Add some animations" (no clear criteria)
- "Fix the styling issues" (assumes context)

### Adapting This for Your Project

The photography portfolio is just one example. This same approach works for:

**E-commerce sites**: Product catalog → Shopping cart → Checkout → Payment → Order management
**SaaS platforms**: Landing page → Sign-up flow → Dashboard → Core features → Billing
**Restaurant sites**: Menu display → Location info → Reservation system → Contact forms

The key is always the same: start with the user experience, work backwards to find dependencies, break into manageable chunks, define success clearly.
